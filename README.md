install-cordova-cli
===================

This script is written by Tom Himanen and published under GPL 1.2 or later. The script installs Cordova CLI (command line interface) on Ubuntu, builds an example project called "HelloWorld" and emulates it just to indicate that everything works. The script has been tested with clean Ubuntu 12.04 LTS installation but should work fine with the most Ubuntu derivatives.
